What is Wolfberry?
==================

I missed NodeJS, so I'm going to reboot my old project Ashgourd and
hopefully actually finish it! Wolfberry is just a simple app to play
board games using your phones.

How do I get this working?
==========================

1. `git clone git@github.com:khwang/wolfberry.git`
2. `npm install`
3. Install mongodb. For instance, if you're on a Mac, `brew install mongodb`
4. `mongo` to start the DB.
5. `node server.js`
